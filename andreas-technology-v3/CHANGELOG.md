# Changelog

The format is based on [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- GSC: `X-Robots-Tag` and static `<meta name="robots">` for thesis presentation; `robots.txt` disallows `/opengraph-image`; sitemap lists only the homepage; root `/favicon.ico` for stable icon URL (thesis HTML restored under `public/`)
- Mobile: fix horizontal page scroll by using `overflow-x-clip` on Experience and Projects sections instead of `overflow-x: hidden` on html/body (which killed momentum scrolling on mobile browsers)

### Added
- SEO: full absolute canonical URL (`andreas.technology`), WebSite + Person JSON-LD with `mainEntityOfPage` and `sameAs` (portfolio first), explicit Open Graph image, expanded keywords (M.Eng, Infrastructure Automation)
- `docs/seo-github-pages.md`: guide to de-emphasize old GitHub Pages (andrewfragkiadakis.github.io) in DuckDuckGo/Google (redirect, noindex, GSC/Bing removals)
- SpotlightCard (ReactBits): mouse-following radial spotlight overlay on skill cards, About code block, and service cards
- LogoLoop tech marquee (ReactBits): 12-item tech stack horizontal ticker under About skills (Python, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Docker, Linux, Git, Bash, Cisco, Active Directory, VMware/ESXi, Jira) with fade edges and pause-on-hover
- LetterGlitch ambient background (ReactBits): canvas letter animation inside About "Current Focus" code block at very low opacity (6%)
- Gradient text accent class: `gradient-text` CSS class with accent-to-purple gradient for animated stat counters
- Mobile accordion on Services: tap to expand/collapse service descriptions; desktop shows all content
- Dynamic OG image: `app/opengraph-image.tsx` generates 1200×630 PNG (dark bg, outlined name, M.ENG. subtitle) via `next/og`; layout metadata uses generated image
- Skip-to-content link in layout.tsx for keyboard/screen-reader accessibility
- `theme-color` meta tags (light + dark variants via `prefers-color-scheme` media)
- Inline `<script>` in `<head>` to read localStorage theme before React hydrates (eliminates theme flash)
- Shared `useCardScroll` hook for consistent card-centering scroll logic across Experience and Projects
- `MainContent` client wrapper enabling `page.tsx` to be a server component
- Bilingual support for all UI copy: about subtitle, services CTA, cinematic entry, contact labels, navigation labels via `content.ts`
- `cinematicEntry` content keys with full EN/GR translations
- Session-based CinematicEntry: only shows once per session (sessionStorage); includes a visible "Skip" button
- `aria-live="polite"` region around typewriter text + visually-hidden static copy for screen readers
- `role="status"` on cinematic entry typewriter for live announcements
- Project card descriptions (`line-clamp-2`) below tags
- Resize handler in HorizontalLayout that snaps to nearest section on viewport resize (desktop)
- "Athens, Greece" added to meta description for local SEO
- Greek translations for hero CTA buttons (`viewWork`, `getInTouch`)
- Language persistence to `localStorage` in LanguageContext (mirrors ThemeContext pattern)

### Changed
- Remove `output: 'export'` and static image OG; use Vercel/server build with dynamic opengraph-image route
- Improve font loading: Inter with `display: 'swap'` to reduce FCP/LCP impact and align globals.css with loaded font
- Improve accessibility: raise contrast for secondary text (opacity-65/50/55 → 80/75) in Contact, Navigation, Experience, About, Projects
- Fix identical-link purpose: add `aria-label="Contact via email"` to both mailto links in Contact and `aria-hidden` on decorative icons
- Accessibility (PageSpeed 96→100): raise Experience vertical labels opacity-20→50; nav links opacity-75→90, MobileNav 70→85; unify mailto aria-label to "Contact via email" (Hero+Contact); add aria-label "GitHub profile" and aria-hidden on Projects CTA
- Perf: lazy-load below-the-fold sections (Experience, Projects, Contact) and HorizontalLayout via next/dynamic; defer Lenis until after first paint (requestIdleCallback after load); preconnect fonts.gstatic.com; CustomCursor uses transform/scale instead of width/height (composited-only animation); add modern browserslist (defaults, not dead, not IE 11)
- Merge dual `<h1>` in HeroOverlay into single `<h1>` with `<span>` children
- Switch hero spotlight from `mask-position` animation to `clip-path: circle()` for compositor-friendly rendering with `will-change: clip-path`
- Refactor `dom/Experience.tsx` from 445 LOC to ~230 LOC: extract `ExperienceCard`, `EducationCard`, `ScrollButton` components; use shared `useCardScroll` hook; eliminate desktop/mobile card duplication
- Replace `unoptimized` prop on project `<Image>` with responsive `sizes` for automatic WebP and responsive images
- Mobile Experience/Education scroll buttons increased to `w-11 h-11` (44px touch target)
- Navigation component now reads all labels from `content.ts` instead of hardcoded ternaries
- MobileNav now reads labels from `content.ts`; removed dead `getElementById('scroller')` references
- Canvas animation loop: add 30 FPS cap via timestamp delta; add `visibilitychange` listener to pause/resume when tab is hidden; remove dead `getElementById('scroller')` code
- ThemeContext: read `localStorage` synchronously in `useState` initializer to prevent flash
- `page.tsx` converted from client component to server component (scroll-reset logic moved to `MainContent`)
- Fix `opportunitesTitle`/`opportunitesDescription` typo → `opportunitiesTitle`/`opportunitiesDescription` in Content interface and data
- Fix "MSc." → "M.ENG." in hero typewriter strings
- Fix university duration "September 2019 – Present" → "September 2019 – June 2025"
- Fix ITIL credential link from expiring LinkedIn URL to permanent `/files/itil-v4-cert.pdf`
- Fix GR `nav.projects` inconsistency: set to "PROJECTS" in both content.ts and Navigation
- Update `site.webmanifest` icon paths to include `/favicons/` prefix; set `theme_color` and `background_color` to `#030014`
- Rename `public/images/Porftolio website/` to `public/images/portfolio-website/` (fix typo + kebab-case) and update all references
- Replace all `any` types in component mappings with proper Content types (`Experience`, `Education`, `Project`, `Service`, `Skill`)

### Removed
- 6 unused dependencies: `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `@types/three`, `@studio-freight/react-lenis`, `react-parallax-tilt` (massive bundle reduction)
- `SmoothScroll.tsx` no-op wrapper component
- `favicon.ico` reference from metadata (file did not exist; using PNG favicons instead)

### Fixed
- CinematicEntry overflow cleanup: add `return () => { document.body.style.overflow = 'auto' }` in useEffect
- Theme flash on page load eliminated via synchronous inline script + synchronous useState initializer

### Security
- Update Next.js 16.0.7 → 16.1.6 to fix 5 high-severity vulnerabilities (GHSA-w37m, GHSA-mwv6, GHSA-9g9p, GHSA-h25m, GHSA-5f7q)
- `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities

## 🐛 Known Issues

**None** - All reported issues have been resolved.

---

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Peer Dependency Warning**: `@studio-freight/react-lenis` was installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 compatibility. This is working correctly and can be ignored.

2. **Image Optimization**: All images use `unoptimized` prop on Next.js Image component for faster development. Consider removing this in production.

3. **Font Awesome CDN**: Using CDN link in `layout.tsx` head. Consider self-hosting for better performance.

4. **Binary Trail**: Cursor is hidden (`cursor-none`) on canvas, showing only binary trail. Adjust if normal cursor is needed.

---

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total Components**: 8 React components
- **Lines of Code**: ~2000+ TypeScript/TSX
- **Languages Supported**: 2 (EN, GR)
- **Projects Showcased**: 8
- **Work Experiences**: 5
- **Skills Highlighted**: 6
