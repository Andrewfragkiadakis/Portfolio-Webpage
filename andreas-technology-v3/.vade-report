# Vercel Speed Insights Integration

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 16.0.7 portfolio project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

### 2. Code Integration
Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after all other content
- Placed after the ThemeProvider/LanguageProvider/SmoothScroll wrapper to ensure proper rendering

## Implementation Details

Since this is a Next.js 16.0.7 project (> 13.5) using the App Router, I used the recommended approach:
- Imported from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (optimized for Next.js App Router)
- Added the component to the root layout file
- No additional configuration needed - the component works automatically

## Verification

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linter ran successfully (no new errors introduced)
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All static pages generated correctly

The Speed Insights component will now automatically track Web Vitals metrics and send them to Vercel when the site is deployed.

## Files Modified
